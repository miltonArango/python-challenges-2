The HERE Programming Challenge:

	Welcome to the HERE Programming Challenge.  You should try to complete all
	three levels in a single sitting.  It should take anywhere from 20 minutes to
	2 hours.
	
	For each level please submit to HERE the answer *and* the code you wrote to
	find that answer. 

  	Level 1
  	----------------------------------------

  	The answer to Level 1 is the longest palindrome embedded in the 
  	gettysburg.txt file.

  	As an example, if the input was "I like racecars that go fast"
  	the answer would be "racecar".


  	Level 2
  	----------------------------------------

  	To determine the answer for Level 2, write code to find the first prime
  	fibonacci number larger than a given minimum.  For example, the first
  	prime fibonacci number larger than 10 is 13.

  	Step 1. Use your code to compute the smallest prime fibonacci number
  	        greater than 227,000.  Call this number X.

  	Step 2. The answer for Level 2 is the sum of prime divisors of X + 1.

  	For the second portion of this task, note that for the number 12 we consider
  	the sum of the prime divisors to be 2 + 3 = 5.  We do not include 2 twice
  	even though it divides 12 twice.


  Level 3
  	----------------------------------------

  	For the final level, you must find all subsets of an array where the 
  	largest number is the sum of the remaining numbers.
  	For example, for an input of:

  	(1, 2, 3, 4, 6)

  	the subsets would be

  	1 + 2 = 3
  	1 + 3 = 4
  	2 + 4 = 6
  	1 + 2 + 3 = 6

  	The numbers.csv file contains the list of numbers you should run your code
  	on. The password is the number of subsets.  In the above case the answer 
  	would be 4.

  	The End
